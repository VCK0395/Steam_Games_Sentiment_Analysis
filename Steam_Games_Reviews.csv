For starters the community of this game sucks just like every online game You don't wanna talk to them because they're all just jerks who wanna say you suck or you camped or blah blah blah its rare to get a nice compliment out of people in this game.But you don't have to talk to the community either. Unlike most online games this one doesn't have a mic system so you don't have to worry about hearing a twelve year old cry baby raging at you for nothing. Only time you can talk to people in the game is in the beginning before the match starts if your a survivor and at the end after the match is over as both killer and survivor The end chat is the only one the killer can talk to everyone in the match though. Mostly just to say GG for Good Game.As Survivor you can basically just play every man for himself and be sneaky and say screw you to the other players or you can try to be a good team mate and rescue them if they get on a hook but if someone is a jerk in the chat before the match then you know who not to save if they get hooked. I mostly play killer because I find it more fun than playing survivor and someones gotta play killer and from what I hear most people enjoy playing survivor more. Probably becuase as survivor it feels like a horror game and you get team mates while as killer you're by yourself.But what i'm really trying to say is this game is really great even though the community sucks Just ignore the community and if you get someone who is raging at the end just say gg to them and leave. After seeing that they didn't make you argue with them and waste your time it might make them even more mad even if you got the last word aka GG. So I give this game a 8/10. I wonder if anyone actually read this review I actually had to take my time to write this because I didn't wanna swear in it so you didn't see nothing but censor hearts that steam likes to do.

06/20/2017,85,2139,612,FALSE,Recommended,Disclaimer I survivor main. I play games for fun not for competition so the DBD community doesn't really get to me. If I get a bad killer that face camps oh well. I die and move on to the next game. If I get a good killer who finds me immediately hooks me (bc I can't juke whoops) and then patrol camps (which I'm 100% OK with) then no biggie. Next game please I think a lot of the community salt from killers comes from dealing with rank one survivors that don't actually play the game properly and just run around and flash the killer in the face. And while that is a legitimate strategy it takes away from the fun of the game in my opinion.As a killer (a horrible one) I've also been called names by survivors who tell me to 'get gud.' Older players ruin it for newer players or players who don't put in 1000s of hours. Just relax and have fun with the game! So what if you don't pip up there is always the next game )That being said this game is crazy fun. Don't let the saltiness of the community keep you from buying the game. Grab it have fun with it and ignore anyone who might give you a hard time ) And don't fixate too much on the ranking process unless you're absurdly highly competitive for some reason (also fine just try not to let it push you into spouts of anger!) and even then recognize that there are jerks who play this game like any other game and have fun while you compete!,Dead by Daylight
12/12/2016,4,55,2694,FALSE,Recommended,"ENGLISH After playing for more than two years I am given the task of reviewing this game again.This review will be as complete as possible so if you do not want to see the full review I recommend you go to the final part of the review to see the opinion and final rating. This review will consist of 5 sections and some sub sections.GameplayThis game consists of there being 4 survivor and one killer who must complete a series of objectives on a map. Survivors must escape from the killer by repairing 5 generators and opening doors. For its part the killers must pursue hang sacrifice or kill the survivors.Survivors and killers have the possibility to use perks objects accessories and offerings that help to give advantage within a game.Offers good mechanics for escaping the killer or catching the survivor as Pallets Windows 360's Moonwalks Hide Different powers in each killerThe balancing is one of the most difficult aspects of the game. Each update changes the balance making nerf or buff to the killer and survivors. In my opinion there are many things where the balancing is good. but there are many other things that fail a lot.Rating Balance 6/10 Mechanical system 9/10 Innovation 8/10 Gameplay 8/10Graphics It uses the graphic engine Unreal Engine 4 which is an engine with quite good lighting and easy to use with respect to other engines. In the graphic section optimization and animation Dead by Daylight is mediocre because there are enough graphic bugs or animation but it must be understood that Behaviour is not Epic game to be able to invest so much money in that aspect. Animation 6/10 Optimization 5/10 Graphics 6/10 Matchmaking In this aspect the game has improved a lot these 2 years but it's still quite mediocre there are quite a few bugs in looking for killers and supervients. The worst thing is that the host is the killer and there are no servers. And besides the rank system fails a lot there are games that can touch you ranks 20 being rank 1. Servers 0/10 Matchmaking 5/10 Conclusion This game has great potential for anyone who likes the ""Slasher"" or wants to spend good nights with friends or killing survivors. That potential is covered up by big bugs.

09/21/2018,2,54,400,FALSE,Recommended,Any longtime Dead by Daylight player knows that this isn't a horror game. If you're looking for scares I wouldn't consider this to be a scary game because it becomes quite predictable over time. It doesn't have enough build up of suspense to instill fear of actually getting caught by the killer. That said and set aside I enjoy a good chase or simply losing the killer's line of sight and giving them the slip. It can be quite funny when you outsmart someone by hiding around a tree or a rock. There have been times where I have lost killers simply by doing circles around an object and remaining hidden. Those moments are where the game succeeds in my eyes. Hide and seek has always been fun for me in games that can manage to get it right and it's one of the aspects that drew me to Dead by Daylight. It's a game about being sneaky and trying not to get caught. On the other hand however getting seen on purpose and taking the killer for a long chase helps your team repair generators unhindered and also gains you plenty of boldness points for distracting and ultimately helping your team escape as a whole because every second a killer spends wasted on chasing a pro runner is a second your 3 teammates need to utilize towards getting the 5 generators in the map up and running to power the exit door. Contentwise there is a continued introduction of new killers and survivors alongside them each with their own unique abilities which keeps things interesting. As with any game I feel the need to mention that a community and the people encountered in online situations are what make and break a game and sometimes it's possible that you get a killer that camps you after he has hung you up on the hook which can be very not fun. I give Dead by Daylight an 8/10 and I've enjoyed my many hours playing and so I will recommend.,Dead by Daylight

12/04/2018,11,106,900,FALSE,Recommended,"This is simultaneously the most fun and most infuriating game I've played in a long time.It's an asymmetrical game where one player is a powerful killer hunting down 4 elusive survivors before they can start generators and leave the trial.For an asymmetrical game it's in a state where it's surprisingly balanced between the two sides. Either side has a few things that infuriate the other (Decisive Strike and No One Escapes Death are the current front runners) and certain killers are notoriously overpowered or underpowered. Freddy Kreuger mains for instance must hate themselves to play that and Nurse mains must just hate playing the game fairly.New content is regular 1 killer 1 survivor 3 perks for each side and a map are released every 3 months or so mid chapter balance patches occur and cosmetics are regularly added.There are downsides however. While balance patches come regularly they won't do anything incremental. Freddy is ridiculously weak but they refuse to give him small quality of life changes that they have said he needs until they are ready to release a full rework of him. Meaning rather than sitting at a 'meh' stage he sits in boring weak and generally unfun.Pay to pay to keep paying. Buying the game will net you around half the cast. Many are also available through grinding however licensed killers and survivors require further payment. Their perks are also locked to you unless they are picked on the ""random"" weekly shrine. (The good ones rarely are.) On top of this despite in game currency being used for cosmetics anything they think looks good or will be popular is locked behind payment only. It's a move when you may have already spent upwards of $80 just to unlock characters.Awesome and incredibly angry community as you'd expect from a game like this.",Dead by Daylight

Where killing requires significantly more concentration survivor is somewhat more chill as an experienced player but is often an M1 simulator if you dont involve yourself with the game much. This repetivity is very clear but the different survivors you play against all have different playstyles and the killers have completely different ""powers"" which can tilt the game at any point. If you want a more relaxing experience to sit down and play something then it would be better to play survivor. Killer requires endless concentration and intense focus so you need to be in a proper gaming mood.I would highly recommend this game to someone who needs a time waster video game and wants to funnel some hours into it in their spare time. It's a good horror for the first 50 hours but loses that factor after you stop taking the game seriously in terms of getting scared. There is a grinding system involved which will take anyone a long time to get anything especially the bare bone amount you earn ingame but achieving the grind and getting the perks (massive game factor) that you want that will greatly change the way you play.

You'll try to quietly find generators to repair whilst continuously looking over your shoulder for the proverbial (and litteral) axe to drop. This game is definitely dark as far as games go but the simplicity behind the game makes the mechanics that much more enjoyable.

Let your friends hang on a hook while you fix generators so you can escape!A very fun and unique game marred by several issues on launch. They did a great job patching all the issues from Beta and I'm sure they'll fix these new issues.Currently the major problem and the thing everyone is complaining about in reviews is that you can't join as groups. I think this was intended because the ability to coordinate outside of the game is extremely powerful. Therefore you can only play in a full private game or not at all. This has resulted in people joining lobbies checking for their friends and then leaving. Over. And over. And over.

08/09/2016,0,0,14,FALSE,Recommended,"Dead by Daylight is certainly a lot of fun with friends. However when I play the game on my own I dont get even near the amount of enjoyment as I would playing the game with a friend. You can either pick to play as a survivor or a killer. When you are the survivor your job is to find and activate FIVE generators (depending on how many survivors there is the number of generators that you have to activate will decrease.) which will then alow you to open a giant gate so you can escape. Therefore winning the game. However if one survivor makes it out that does not mean the rest of the survivors make it out with you. The remaining survivors will have to find the gate that you have opened so they can escape also. However you dont necessary have to activate all FIVE generators. There is a trap door which is hidden in every map and if you find the trap door then you can escape immediately without having to activate any generators. However the downside is that the game developers have updated the game so every time you spawn into the map the trap door will never be in the same place. Making it of course very hard to find. The killers job is of course to try and stop the survivors from escaping by killing them. At the moment there are only 3 killers you can play as. Each killer has a diffrent ability that they can use to hunt the survivors. The first killer you can play as is called ""Trapper"" and his ability is to lay down bear traps. The killer himself can also get trapped in his own bear traps however he can escape in 3 seconds. The second killer is called ""Wraith"" and his special ability is to go invisable. Which of course makes it very hard for the survivors to see him until it is too late. The invisabilty also makes him also very quite and what I mean by that is this.....When you play as the survivor if a killer gets near you your heart beat increases and gets louder. Telling the player playing as the survivor to hide or otherwise your going to get ed by the killer and lose the game. But when you play as Wraith you can not attack survivors whilst invisable which means you have to decloak to kill. The last killer you can play as is the least popular one where his special ability is a chainsaw but it is very hard to control and use effectively to kill. Moving on now. Playing with 4 or less friends will mean its going to take forever for the bloody game to find a match. Most of the time when you are playing with 4 or less friends you just keep pressing the ready button because each time it cant find a match it resets everyone to ""not ready"". Its like the game doesnt even really try to find a match. The game says ""searching for match"" then less than 2 seconds later is says ""failed to find match"". Its like ""Come game put some ing effort into finding a match will ya!?"" This is the biggest flaw at the moment and hopefully in the next patch or two this will have been fixed. Because like I have said at the start of me writing this review. The game is most fun when playing with friends. So my verdict for this game at the moment is........6/10. This game does show real potential and is really good fun when it finds a bloody match. So the sooner they fix that issue the better.",Dead by Daylight

How it works is that there is 4 survivors trying to escape from a killer. The killers objective is to sacrafice all 4 survivors. The survivors objective is to work together to escape the place you are stuck in. The objective is that you have to repair and fix 5 generators. Those generators will power the main gates which you will then half to open to actually escape. While you are doing this there is a killer that witnesses every mistake you do. Don't screw up. Work together. Stay alert Stay alive. I rate this game a solid 10/10 for it's huge creativity and caring updates.,Dead by Daylight

08/13/2018,0,0,111,FALSE,Recommended,"Honestly With the nerf to a certain set of perks (Exhaustion) The game is much more balanced then its ever been in my opnion and this comes from a survivor main. Ive played a decent ammount of killer and survivor and let me tell you that if someone tries to tell you that its heavily against one side then thats either old information or they are very biased. The gameplay itself is addictive as all hell and most definitly worth your money if youve ever played and enjoyed a game like it before. This game is what Friday the 13th should be but it doesnt just focus on the single killer like that game does. Each killer is fun maybe not on par with one another but still fun to play as all the same. The Devs do a Q&amp A on reddit every week and the reddit also has a ""No Stupid Questions"" day where theyll answer anything you could want to ask. All and all this game is making good progress and i hope to see it get even better than what it is now. Buy it and Welcome to the Fog!",Dead by Daylight

06/15/2016,0,0,19,FALSE,Recommended,This game is very fun. I played with just one other friend and we had a blast. It was really fun to chase him and it was really fun to get chased.There are two cons The graphics are nice though some things seem like they are not in the world. The people and the killer seem kinda weird to me (I am running on ultra) Perhaps the biggest There is no grouping up with friends for public matches which this game really needs. This game is such a social game and for groups of players that are less than 5 it I will imagine will get tiring hunting the same people.When they add this (because duh they will) this game is definitly worth the pricetag of 20 euros.,Dead by Daylight
06/15/2016,0,0,80,FALSE,Recommended,I bet this is the co op survival horror that I loved the most. Everything is great but only worst thing is to create party or group if I want to play as public with friends. Please update this issue,Dead by Daylight
06/15/2016,0,0,2,FALSE,Recommended,I have a couple of hours logged on this game now so I thought I would leave a first impressions review.This game is great. The concept is great and the delivery is great. It brings me to mind of all those 70s 80s and 90s horrors which are so copied today but never bettered. Friday the 13th is the most obvious example. In this game you play as either a survivor or a psycho killer. The job of the survivors is to activate generators which power an exit. Once enough of the generators are powered it becomes a mad rush to the exit before the killer picks you off. As the killer your job is simple. Incapacitate the survivors and sacrifice them to the sky portal on various hooks dotted around the world. I believe that the locations of the generators and the hooks are random each time but of that I am unsure. There are a few problems with this game which I noticed straight away and are mostly to do with balance. It is simply too easy as the Killer. You move faster than the survivors are able to hear them when they work on the generators (this is visually represented by an icon) and there are too many hooks around the world. These things overpower the Killer and not in a fun way. Yes the killer should be difficult but not to the point where it is unfun to play as the killer because it is simply a walk in the park. You want players to relish both otherwise there will come a point when being a survivors outnumber killers and finding a lobby will be even harder than it already is. My advice would be to remove some of the hooks maybe only leave the basement hooks so that the killer must return to his lair and protect it from survivors who make rescue attempts. At the moment it is far to easy for the killer to be mobile all over the place. He can down a survivor hang them on a hook and still have time to reach a generator before a survivor activates it. If hooks were not so close at hand it would also make the whole escape mechanic whereby you must wiggle LS in order to struggle free a worthwhile addition. At the moment it is impossible to escape unless the killer takes his sweet time on purpose. Another addition that is much needed is for there to be many more different types of hiding place. At present there are only out of place looking cupboards but trash cans dumpsters and whatnot would add some variety and force the killer into looking more. Those are just some suggestions. Other than that the game is great and I am sure more tweaks are coming.,Dead by Daylight
06/15/2016,0,0,7,FALSE,Not Recommended,you'd expect someone to save you but no they just let you hang on the hook while you're getting slaughtered by some spider creature.basically what im saying is add a ing singleplayer because it would be some much better than running around with people who dont give a about you even though thats part of the game.,Dead by Daylight
06/15/2016,0,0,19,FALSE,Recommended,10/10 im hooked,Dead by Daylight
06/15/2016,0,0,10,FALSE,Recommended,There is a bug in this game that is really annoying to me. Whenever i join a game it takes less than 5 minutes for it to tell me that i have escaped and it doesn't even give me the blood points for escaping. This bug also happens in private matches. I just want to know if this is happening to any of you guys. But overall when i am playing (which is very little) it is actually a really fun game. I would recommend this game to anybody.,Dead by Daylight
06/15/2016,0,0,1,FALSE,Recommended,I really want to add a positive thumb for this game it doesn't deserve half of its bad reviews.I haven't come across a more unique enjoyable and genuinely scary concept for a game in a long time. Dead by Daylight really takes me back to my young teens watching 90s slasher movies with my heart in my throat. This game is great a breath of fresh air in the genre... i'm really looking forward to future dlc and content already,Dead by Daylight
06/15/2016,0,0,2,FALSE,Recommended,This game just dropped coming out of beta and is a 4 v 1 slasher film type of game where you have 4 survivors taking on 1 killer each killer has their own quirks between the trapper who can user a knife and traps the wraith type who can vanish and be invisable but not attack until visable and the hillbilly with his brutalk chainsaw attack between the slashers and survivors you can upgrade their look as well as some perks and materials as you gain point through the game. If you are playing as the killer you must find the 4 people and kill them by slashing them and putting them on hooks until they die and preventing escape as the survivors you must find 5 engines to restart including a space bar QTE in order to open 2 gates to escape.Overall the game is alot of fun thus far but seems better with friends so you can communicate with each tother but even without i find it fun they just need to fix some bugs in the game still like getting stuck as the killer on a window.I say give it time and see some updates if your on the fence but if you really like 4 v 1 action this is some very fun action. you can check out my gameplay on my youtube channel herehttps //youtu.be/OT5z2Zmhs3A,Dead by Daylight

08/19/2016,0,0,6,FALSE,Recommended,Dead by Daylight ReviewOverviewDead by Daylight is a 4v1 Horror game. 4 survivors 1 killer. There are now 4 choosable killers from the 'last breath' free update. There are also 5 selectable survivors. Survivors are launched into the map in thirdperson while the killer is in first person. Each killer has a special skill. The Trapper has a bear trap that can be placed. The Wraith may turn invisible but has a bell sound turning it on and off. The Hillbilly has a deathly chainsaw charge. Finally the Nurse has a 'blink' ability allowing her to teleport in a straight line. Each survivor and killer has a unique upgrade system but I will not go too much into detail in this review. GameplayThe gameplay in Dead by Daylight is truely unique. When you spawn in as a survivor your objective is to escape the map. To do this you must find generators and turn them on. You must hold left click while having short timed moments where you must press space in the white. If you do this incorrectly a loud explosion occurs and it attracts other survivors and of course the killer. When all 4/5 generators are completed the 2 gate openings will open. This takes a while but opens a gate to escape. If you are the last survivor alive a trap door will open randomly on the map. You can quickly jump into this and escape. The killer as I said before is in first person giving him a slight disadvanage. To know if the killer is near a heartbeat soud effect will occur. The louder it is the closer the killer is to you. The only way the heartbeat sound does not take place is when The Wraith is invisible but you can see him and it takes around 4 seconds for him to become uninvisible. There are now 4 different maps in the game. Each map is different and takes time to learn. The killer needs 2 hits on you for you to go down. They will then pick you up and take you to a hook (You can wiggle out of his grasp if you are fast enough). A bar will then appear in your name which is your meter to live. Before the meter gets half drained you can attempt to escape. There is only a 10% chance of you escaping though. When the bar goes half down you must spam space to stay alive. Other survivors can save you from this hook. Items in the game can be found in crates or you can get them from upgrades in your survivor upgrade tree. The torch lasts 5 seconds by default and can immobolize the killer if they are holding another survivor (which will drop the survivor). The medkit can be used to heal teammates. The toolkit is used to sabotage hooks. There are other items but I don't know the full extent to them. Also around the map there are closets which you can hide in but they make a sound when you enter them so I wouldn't reccommend getting in them. There is also no communication between survivors so if your playing by yourself prepared to be frustrated worried and scared as hell.ConclusionDead by Daylight is a fun game for anyone out there. If your worried that the game is too scary it really isn't. If you have $20 to spare I would definetly reccomend this game.,Dead by Daylight

I really hate the modern system of match making really I prefer it when there is a server list to pick from like the good old days. Why can't this clearly working method of finding mulitplayer games remain? Why force us to wait in a matchmaking system? Ridiculous. Aside from that multiplayer issue. The game itself is great very fun and I am finding being a survivor quite a tense experience and being the killer a thrill.

Some of the maps have ""safe zones"" areas with only one or two hooks and plenty of obstacles which are made increasingly difficult if one of the survivors has the sabotage perk.

04/18/2018,0,0,557,FALSE,Recommended,I may come back to write more later but thought I'd just quickly put down a very strong recommendation for this game. There's a bunch of frustrating stuff in there to do with other players but there's also a lot of really great things and the game itself is brilliant.4 survivors vs 1 killer and they have to repair generators open the exit gates and escape while trying to be stealthy escaping the killer and helping each other out. The killer roams around kicking generators and cutting up survivors before sticking them on hooks to sacrifice them. Works pretty well! Loads of perks and items lots of maps and characters. The game is updated and gets new content lots and it has my favourite take on a skill tree.If you don't own it it's well worth a go even if you don't normally like horror games. I never thought I'd like this sort of game and mainly picked it up to play it with someone. I'm very glad I did as it's turned into one of my favourite games. You're missing out on a really great time if you don't try it.To youto!,Dead by Daylight

08/20/2016,0,0,2,FALSE,Recommended,Product received for free. The game is fun for what it is. I think group play with friends is the best aspect of the game though. The maps seem limiting and the controls aren't great. I would love to have a toggle crouch instead of just having to hold down crouch all the time. I just played over the free weekend but it did not grab me enough to purchase. Maybe create a discounted 5 pack to make it more of a group game instead of looking for lobby which during my time playing kicked me out of my party 6 times and we had to regroup. I will recommend this game because it is fun but make sure you have a full group to play it with.,Dead by Daylight
08/20/2016,0,0,165,FALSE,Recommended,Product received for free. This game is tons of fun! Im assuming a large sum of the people writing negative reviews have never even leveled their killer or survivor past level 25. I say this because that is when you unlock the fourth and last perk slot and perks help a ton in this game. The first two days of playing this game was very hard as a survivor with only one perk iron will 1 I found myself dying a lot as other survivors had premonition 3 speed burst 3 and other very helpfull/NEEDED perks kept escaping and winning the match. Starting this game as a survivor is very hard but if youre able to persevere through and past rank 25 you will find yourself escaping more often and youll also learn a lot on how to juke and hide from the killer. As for the killer its a whole different story as the first two days of playing this game I was able to become a rank 10 killer with only one perk Iron Grasp 1. I kept finding and killing all four survivors every match. However do not hook camp as youll easily lose the game and hopefully even a pip. Im glad the developers encouage you to keep looking for survivors and not just kill one after another however many rank 20 killers dont know this and proceed to hook camp and ruin the game for the survivors by not even giving them a chance. This is another reason why it is so hard to start as a survivor because youre likely to have a match with a hook camper with a 1/3 chance.Overall 9/10 game for me it was just a really rough start all bugs aside I would recommend this game only to people that are willing to play a game that requires you to play ALOT before you actually get good skill and perk wise.,Dead by Daylight
08/20/2016,0,0,1,FALSE,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Terrible matchmaking where the killer is the host.Waiting for people to ready up is cancer.Most of the time the killer camps you after they put you on a hook or they camp one of the exits to the map.Definitely not worth over 3 dollars for the insane lack of content much less the original $20 price.The upgrade and loadout system is precedurally generated. Ew.After your first game of winning as the survivor you've experienced basically everything you can as a survivior.Insanely long loading times sometimes.Trying to play in a lobby with 1 2 friends takes a long time.Overall not worth the buy.,Dead by Daylight

05/19/2017,0,0,532,FALSE,Recommended,I tell you...this game is just a masterpiece in my eyes. The concept of it just never gets old and there are various maps perks killers and survivors to unlock and level AND prestige (which comes with cool rewards). What makes this game so good is that every chase pallet stun 360 juke blind save close calls and everything possible can get your adrenaline pumping. Sure this game is hard to just buy and be good at it but I've had quite a bit of experience on my hands. What also makes it so great is if you hate surviving against an annoying killer then you can play that annoying killer and learn so much about ways to avoid that specific character. Or if you hate inifinites then play survivor. There are a variety of ways to play and win when it comes to this game (cough cough* unlike F13 The Game) it makes any match interesting.P.S I am still giving this game a good review even though my progress was resetP.P.S I got my progress back because of how great Behaviour is and was awarded 20 000 000 bps back,Dead by Daylight

06/30/2018,0,0,628,FALSE,Recommended,"Before you buy this game answer this?Are you sure you are going to be playing with your friends majority of the time in swf? Or are you going to fly solo. This game with friends is indeed the better choice as you can have laugh rage all together about the killer camping majority of the time. If you decide to play survivor majority of the time get ready for salty killers? And if you intend to fly solo as a killer its the same thing. There is salt everywhere in this game. But with the power of teamwork you can overcome with even greater salt. However this game is all about grinding at the moment. You would see YouTubers who have tier 3 perks in all 4 slots. But when you play you're gonna be starting. (unless you do kyf but im talking about grinding). It should maybe take two or three days tops to get your suitable perks but damn it takes forever. I'm still trying to get two more characters to level 50 and i havent even gotten to any killer (except trapper yeah i know survivor main here). If you play salty games like League of Legends (this is just an example) then be prepared for the worst because it ain't very different. If you fly solo everyone is more or less is fending for themselves. ""oh but wait shiro what about flashlight saves and op medkits plays (ex syringe or stypic which is not op).""They are farming you. Getting points so they can ""help"" you out when in reality they are just trying to rank up. In conclusion if you start you better grind...hard. Because this game can be horrible when it comes to grinding and it becomes scary at first but just remember when you play over the course of the game your not gonna be scared like ""OH ITS A WRAITH!!!! RUN!!!!!"" Instead you are going to be like ""uh oh guys its the wraith easy match"" or ""ugh im getting tunneled again stupid baby killer"". You will hate this game at some point because devs are still fixing these issues but goodness it can be one sided these days.Anyways thats all i wanted to say thank you for reading and have a wonderful day or night )",Dead by Daylight

07/01/2018,0,0,142,FALSE,Recommended,This game is the ultimate fantasy of every horror fan out there. I just can't wait for the Dead by Daylight film and hope they don't muck it up that's how good this game is. It 100% deserves a movie.Traditional run of the mill games (random example Skyrim) will have me gritting my teeth because some areas are just creepy (What a wuss right?) but Dead by Daylight has me eagerly putting my best 'offering' forward running for the next generator anxiously wondering who the killer is and whether he's gonna GIT me or not. It's all a rollercoaster of excitement even for someone who's as chicken as I always was before this game conditioned me into thoroughly enjoying the thrill of horror.Well fleshed out characters with just the right amount of information you'd like for each survivor. Each killer unique to DbD has their own well written story as well with the right amount of depth provided.Aesthetically everything in this game looks beautiful actually it's not all grit and gore. The Entity can actually be beautfiul and poetic looking (as angsty as that sounds) and the writing isn't cheesy or over the top. The characters look like everyday normal people and are given options that enforce their own personal style.The gameplay is fun and filled with heart pounding anticipation. It does have bugs and a rare glitch or two getting stuck between trees on Lampkin Lane is never fun but you may have a killer or teammates that may recognize and help or hinder. It's all in the sport of it and it's fun either way. There are times where campers can be cringey (hey it's a strategy...I guess) or that skip lag is working in someone's favor...but as far as mp/co games are concerned you'll definitely spend more time having fun than being tilted.The DLC they release is always innovative I always find myself surprised with each release and it entices users to play. Their updates are usually filled with bug fixes or improvements/new features/aesthetic additions which is great for the gameplay and visuals alike.The community is mostly good. I've run into some poor sports some jerks but that's unavoidable nowadays. Nothing you can't report and nothing the next great match with potentially fun players can't fix. )I could go on and on about this game. Get it! Totally worth it.,Dead by Daylight

After getting this on the free weekend I can say with certainty i did enjoy myself sure there are bugs and a lot of them but the onlly ones i ran into were around the main menu (couldn't join friends matches freezing etc which were all fixed by closing and reopening the game) ton of fun if you can grab three or four friends and pllay private matches or survive online together. Other than bugs the most annoying thing about this game was having to remake your friend lobbies after every match or leaving and creating a new lobby to switch who the killer is in your group.All in all a good game i could see myself paying the $15 dollar (Canadian) price for it.EDIT After coming back to the game from a long hiatus I remembered why i stopped playing in the first place the ridiculously over powered new killers. I don't want the game to be easy for survivors but it shouldnt be impossible. How is it fair as a survivor to have apparently infinite axes thrown across vast distances? Whats the point in pulling pallets down when they can just axe you from a distance. And why is it an option the kill the players with your weapon in the first place? That doesnt make the game fun for anyone it makes it one sided and ruins the rank of the survivors when they end the game with 2000 points.,Dead by Daylight

08/19/2016,0,0,40,FALSE,Recommended,Product received for free. Since this game was free at the time I had the opportunity to play the game as a ''trail.'' I started the game and played 2 games 1 as survivor and 1 as a killer. Both were intense and fun even for me who can't even sit on my own couch and watch a horror movie and hate jumpscares. I later found out my friend got home from work. I told him to download Dead by Daylight so he did. Once we both started the game up we had issues. We could not find a game and it was impossible to find one. After 10 minutes he just gave up. I tried right after he left it worked again. I played 3 games after that. 2 of the 3 I escaped successfully. To be honest this game has its ups and downs but for $20 I think it is totally worth it. If you are not into the horror scene this is a great starter introduction. For the gameplay it is VERY good. It is very well enjoyable if you are alone or if you have a full party of 5. The idea is unique and fun. Both sides survivor and killer are relatively equal. I would give this game a 8/10 for a great starting horror game. ),Dead by Daylight

06/16/2018,0,0,125,FALSE,Recommended,Very fun game at its core. Great concept with interesting characters to play.The balance is really out of whack. Survivors are exceedingly in control of the game to the point that only 3 killers are considered viable at Mediumhigh High rank and only 1 of them are consistant.Even at lower ranks as most killers you start the match in the hole and have to fight your way out of it. The Devs do not seem to be on top of this issue sadly.Despite its flaws it is addictive Fun and full of character and I recommend it because it will most likely just keep improving.,Dead by Daylight

06/14/2016,0,0,585,FALSE,Recommended,Amazing game! This is truly an amazing experience and packed with hours of fun! This is a 1v4 horror survival game where the killer must hunt down the 4 survivors as they repair generators to escape the killer's hunting ground. Pros Multiple killers/survivors to suit your killing/surviving play style Interesting Level Progression Web (The Blood Web) that's infinate Music and sounds are amazing and give the game a great vibe to it Gives off a really creepy atmosphear on every map Plenty of maps to play Kill your friends mode! (sorry if you don't have enough friends they are adding a fix for this!) Skill checks are easy but keep players alert and actually doing something besides clicking and waiting. Haven't seen a single hacker since launch (day 12 now? Will update later if needed)Cons Buggy as hell I excpected a lot less bugs since this just went through alpha and beta just ended but that's okay... every game has bugs they just need to get fixed... Must have a group of 5 to play with if you're inviting friends for it to be any fun ( this is being added in the next major patch ) Window jumpers... ONLY annoying when they are the last alive. Laggy characters/servers at times Alt+F4 to save your rank. Why? Are you that bad you can't get it back?Over all rating 8.5/10Overall If this game continues to get patched and updated with more killers maps survivors etc. it has the potential to stay an amazing game!,Dead by Daylight

The stories for each character really get you into their thoughts and feelings and you can customize each character you play based on your playstyle. Leveling up your survivor or killer is incredibly simple and can be rewarding. The game runs incredibly smoothly at least on my computer and has very eerie audio which makes you constantly on the edge of your seat. Usually you can find a lobby rather quickly to play with other people which is really nice and the community seems really friendly at least to me! Overall great purchase!Edit After a long time of playing the game it takes an incredibly long time at least for me to find a lobby when playing the Killer which turns me off from playing that side. There are also A LOT of connection issues to different lobbies when trying to find a game. However when you do find a game it is insanely fun! D",Dead by Daylight

08/09/2018,0,0,304,FALSE,Recommended,Its really complicated to review this gameOkay let's start with a good thingDead by Daylight has a great and unique concept of a game where 4v1 survival game with objective to survive alive or to kill 4 people if you played as killer. This game have a good graphics and really interesting to play because every killer or item and perks you used have different skill and function and really helps your objective in some situation with a rarity too just like a rpg game. This game also require some teamplay and really interesting to play with friend. The feeling of horror will be felt when you first play the game and the feeling of become a slayer just like in the serial killer movie is very thrilling and felt so intense. Really recommended. But This game have a huge balance issue this issue caused by many things perks game mechanics map design and many more have a big problem. And sometimes you will feel stressed and have no fun to play because killer got bullied by 4 player or cant have your second chance alive as survivor because the killer really wants you to die so bad. This game also have a really really toxic community this endless debate from surv main and killer main caused by balance issue really stressful.,Dead by Daylight
08/20/2016,0,0,1760,FALSE,Recommended,"The very best time waster there is to relax and pump yourself up at the same time. When you want to have an adrenaline rush big enough to pump you up and have a great time but small enough to keep you relaxed this is the game. Unlike say CS GO or StarCraft 2 Rocket League brings the best of both worlds casual and competitive play and blends the two together to give you the most fun possible. The skill cap in this game is incredibly high and you can never stop learning and getting better. It's fun to play it's fun to watch and also it's fun to fool around in additional modes (currently there are basketball and hockey variations along with Rocket Labs game mode with custom funnily twisted maps.) Oh and did I mention how much fun it is to customize your car? It's crazy. Pick a model paint it in different patterns pick the wheels boost pattern add a hat an antenna (or don't) and you can roll around in your awesome pirate or Holy Religion Jesus Something themed vehicle.You can really feel the speed of your car and the adrenaline kick is enough for a dopamine rush compared to getting high on chocolate flavour after workout pizza weed straight from the best weed plantation on the face of the earth.Buy it if you want to lose your 15 hours from your week every week.

01/04/2016,0,0,712,FALSE,Recommended,EDIT Going to change this review to a pros/cons review because I got all into it.PROS+ Gameplay is very different from any other sports game which in this case makes this probably the best sports game out there. (No hate on sports fans I'm just a lazy er sitting on his desk all day long)+ Soundtrack is great+ The car customization it's really wide and you have a ton of options to choose from. (More coming )+ The game runs on my pc really well. Can play it on ultra with fps rarely dropping below 60.+ Unreal engine+ Game's price is spot on+ DLC is worth buying if you're interested in having more customization options. Since the DLC is cosmetic only it won't affect gameplay and thus is really well done.CONS Can get a bit grindy for some (personally idc) Community has become pretty toxic lately but what would you expect from a competitive game anyways. (Huge thank you for the small heroes who aren't being toxic I love you all!)And to sum this review up this game is 100% worth getting.

01/11/2016,0,0,395,FALSE,Recommended,"Rocket League is a amazing game with simple ideas behind it hence it is ""Easy to play Hard to master"". The Game offers more dimensions to it then I first initially thought when i started playing rather than just mastering the skill behind hitting the ball(quite harder than you think when you first start) more aspects start to appear as you progress through the game. The Pay2Win effect is minimal in the game where cars do differ in terms of hitpoints/turning speed/control but is not a big deal. I would say how you get better/stronger in the game is from your own determination and practice. Even so you can still have some fun when you start playing and it will only get better from there when you start mastering more advanced aspects.Lastly the community is alright though it is still better than most. If you learn and understand the key aspects behind how teamwork works in the game such as Positioning and rotations(these should be fundamental) then people in your team shouldn't be giving you much trouble. However the game may get bit too competitive in which players may start throwing insults especially if your beating them by alot. Nonetheless there are still people out there that will always complain about stuff but its tolerable in this game.In Conclusion there is more to this simple game where it creates more enjoyment as you become better as a player. Understand key concepts and you will enjoy this game. I apologize for the large body of texts perhaps dot points may have been better.",Rocket League®

In a small mixing bowl add the ricotta and mash with a fork. Add in the 3 cheese blend Cheddar cheese eggs salt and pepper. Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth paste like consistency. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Make the Ravioli dough. Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water oil and salt. Mix. Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs water oil and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed. Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough. Take the dough out of the mixing bowl shape it into a ball and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic. Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters. With a cookie cutter or upside down water glass cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15 20 dough circles). Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells. Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough. Fill a small bowl with water dip your fingers in and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle. Fold the dough in half over the filling making a half moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a homemade touch as well. Repeat this process for all your dough circles. Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker. Roll the dough into two sheets Place one sheet on the ravioli maker and form the filling cups. Fill with the ravioli mixture. Lay the second sheet of dough on top and roll it out. This will seal in the filling. Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5 6 minutes or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test. If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time you can freeze the rest Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce grate some fresh cheese over it and enjoy!",Grand Theft Auto V

My review is due to the practices of its publisher.While (I believe) they retracted their cease and desist against OpenIV my review still remains negative. TakeTwo continues to give no s for their player base and only pursues profits often at the expense of their customers. I play this game for a few days straight every few months when my friends and I decide we wanna screw around if I played more often I would go insane. While TakeTwo cracks down on anything illegitimate involving ingame currency hackers are not uncommon. Last time I played I would run into a hacker atleast once a day. Teleportation is fine invincibility is fine aimbot is fine BUT MONEY HACKS? BAN! It is apparent that TakeTwo cares more about making money than delivering a quality game experience and will implement trends originating from other games *cough* the new battle royale mode *cough* just to further profits.I will not be purchasing any other GTA or RDR title unless TakeTwo does a massive turn around or someone buys the series from them.,Grand Theft Auto V

Hackers they're literally EVERYWHERE so many that it's hard to find a pure session you're lucky if you can find one. Multiplayer is fun when played with friends (you know you can trust them) multiplayer should be played in private session where nobody can join (just hacker things).

And today for some reason my garage got bugged and I lost 2 of my expensive cars which were fully upgraded ( I am a returning player from xbox 360 ) and now each time I put a car there it gets duplicated but the duplicated one does nto really exist but still takes up the garage slot to park a car.If you want to play the game without issues and problems stay away from it for 1 month and then try hopefully rockstar has solved these issues.,Grand Theft Auto V

09/05/2017,7,162,673,FALSE,Recommended,"This is my 600 hour review.I'll break this down between single player and online.Because I have different opinions on both.First is Single Player because its easy.Single Player is a near perfect masterpiece. Probabaly the absolute best single player game of all time. If you are looking into this game for SP then its a no brainer.However next we have ""GTA Online""Its a mixed review.I have a lot of hours into online and I will continue to put a lot of additional hours into online.PROS It gets constant content added several times a year the release ""free"" DLC'sThere really is a lot to do if you wish you can really role play the most corrupt criminal to the fullest extent.CONS I'll just start out with the biggest con.The game has clearly taken a big turn in the last couple years and its intesifying toward micro transactions.Its pretty obvious the keep raising the prices of items you purchase in game compared to the amount of money you earn. Unless you are dedicating your life to this game its pretty hard to obtain the in game items. And if you are starting out as a new player the amount of money you need to catch up is really a huge obstacle. I am not one of those people who are defiantly against micro transactions but these aren't even fair micro transactions.Rockstar keeps raisning the price of the in game items but the amount of money given out on a ""shark card"" has never been adjusted. Here is an example a 8 Million dollar shark card (unless on sale) costs $99 always has.It use to be that most items were under 1 million with the extremely high dollar things around $2 million.So for $99 you could typically buy say 5 15 items for $99. Fast forward to today. Most items are over 1 million closer to 2 million on average) and the most expensive items are 4 million with a yet to be released item that is going to be 6.5 million. Rockstar is really going for a money grab here and they aren't even attempting to hide it. Not to mention that the latest DLC the amount of money you can earn per hour has actually gone down from the previuous ones. So higher prices to buy stuff lower income from doing work. So you are forced to not really play the new DLC but the old ones for cash. Which is a shame because the new missions are actually very fun they just dont pay well.So if you are new and want to ever come close to catching up to current players you have 3 choices. 1.) Buy Shark Cards and ALOT of them. Several hundred dollars worth. 2.) Play an insane amount of hours quit life and play this game every day all day long 3.) Cheat Find mods or a modder and get ""modded money"". Warning you can actually get banned for this. I cant even beleive I am giving this advice out I use to depise money modders but given the greed coming out of Rockstar now days I really understand why new players would do it and I dont frankly care anymore.So you might ask Why do I have this game as recommmened still.When it comes down to the game itself single player and even online. It's fun there is a lot of varitey I can do missions I can race cars I can pvp I can play mini games (and there are dozens of varietys of games) I've played 600 hours and honeslty still to this day havent even played 1/2 the things you can do. There is a massive amount of content. The game is fun.The politics behind the scenes is horrible the comminity is toxic and the micro tranactions are getting out of control. But at the core its still fun and I still enjoy it after all this time. But on the other hand we probabbaly wouldnt get all these updates without the microtransactions so there is that factor too.I rate GTA 5Single Player gameplay 10/10Online Gameplay 8/10 ( 2 for community)Variety of things to do 10/10Game Updates 8/10Microtranactions 0/10",Grand Theft Auto V

However seeing the Total Biscuit review for the game convinced me to give this game a try.Honestly I'm blown away in regards to how good this game actually is. The attention to detail and the grand scale of the world is really amazing.I have only a few hours in so far but I am completely sold by how good the game actually is and look forward to playing it for many hours more.,Grand Theft Auto V

All i can say is i didn't realise i purchased ""Loading Simulator 2020 HD Edition""Kidding aside to elaborate of my '91hours' on record at this moment its safe to say ive spent 3/4 of it loading! Holy Crap man. On start up Online mode Missions/Heists Starting them inbetween choosing more missions finishing missions/heists(which constantly crash while loading which gets you locked loading with no way out other than to either Alt + F4 or try join someone elses game with Rockstar social club thing if anyone else is on) Though this is a personal niche of mine. Cutscenes (that you cant skip &amp some you can after you have seen it before if one person hasn't seen one before in heists sit back and watch a good 5min odd cutscene each time). Thats just some parts that need loading.I know what your thinking ""well of course you need to wait for loading stupid head!""And your right! good job fellow nublet. See now this wouldn't be an issue at all assuming loading times were minimal and the amount of times to load were minimal but hey that would be too mainstream 5min loading time average assuming you don't time out/Crash and need to load up the whole damn game from the beginning and as mentioned above there's just too much if you want to make people load up 5 mins for 2mins of gameplay thats fine i guess at least make sure it god damn loads up.Now lets get into things that need fixes. like joining friends sometimes you cant join friends from a number of issues like having not done tutorial(even though you have done it before). Also an issue where you may be buying stuff from convenience store dude for snacks and if someone comes around and holds it up while your in it you are stuck there unable to move or get out even after the thing is over. Missing weapons sometimes you lose weapons/lose all weapons and need to buy them all again. idling time out 2min idle time it seems. Which is fair enough but i personally think its too short maybe 5mins.(only a problem since you gotta load in again yay more loading screens. Which funny enough if your stuck in a loading screen you cant idle out which is the only thing i can imagine the idle out being somewhat useful)In fact as I am typing this I am stuck ""Loading"" Launching a mission for the past 10mins with no way out because you cant just press esc to leave the only way out is to alt + F4 and exit the whole game and load it up from the beginning which takes about 5 10mins just to boot up. I just...... no words. Wait Loading simulator 2020 HD Edition.ALL that negitive aside the game runs great when it works. Which is funny because sometimes as your playing the game still crashes. Happens randomly though not too often. Though i wouldn't know having not really played much of the god damn game. Sorry too busy crashing at loading screens and sitting through loading screens to get a really good run.

10/27/2017,0,0,593,FALSE,Not Recommended,I have been playing GTA V since its original release date for the Xbox 360 then transferred to PS4 then transferred again to PC. This game has taken more hours from my life than any other and I don't regret anything about it. The reason I'm writing this review and recommending against this game is purely due to the money hungry practices that Rockstar and Take Two show regularly.Don't get me wrong this game is incredibly fun. The single player is some of the best out there and mods make this game more entertaining than games coming out today (Even though there was an attempt to take down the modding community but I'm not gonna go into that. The overflow of negative reviews and public outcry took care of that for me). The part I question is the unavailability of content updates in single player. There have been updates in past games and all have been successful and I guarantee you that if the online content was local people would be much happier with this game. I personally believe that the reason this has not happened is purely due to the lack of payment for single player content.Online the multiplayer experience that everyone I knew was excited for. At first online was a roaring success and I personally played for countless hours attmpting to get as far as I could. Then the first signs of greed occurred... I have seen prices go so high up that the clouds are jealous and money being made stay the same if not lower. This essentially ruined the ability of being able to buy anything enjoyable in online without shelling out hundreds of dollars on shark cards.Overall and to keep this review from turning into a ranting wall of text I enjoyed this game. It's worth its price especially if it's on sale... for single player content. If I'm speaking exclusively about online I would not touch this game with a 100 foot pole due to the online community support system and blatant greed being shown by this game's developer/publisher and I have to recommend my review against this game purely in an attempt to encourage others to vote with thier wallets.,Grand Theft Auto V

If you want it for the multiplayer make sure you don't mind playing with idiots you do not know and have the patience of a buddhist monk when something goes wrong with ... whatever the UI the joining system the friend system the message system the heist system the combat system the cellphone crap system basically everything is a bug that sometimes works as you would want it to.You can't play with exactly whom you want and that's the only reason why cheaters are a problem in this game. And there's no way to report said cheaters unless you are still playing with them which according to other reviewers yields a high chance of you getting banned.*also the game isn't worth it's price in multiplayer It feels like a complete miss I do not exactly how to put it into words but they had a tremendous potential and ressources at their disposal and yet the multiplayer feels wrong. There's a level system okay that's not bad in itself but it's used to unlock IMPORTANT things (which you also have to pay for so it's a dual lock) instead of just being here to tell that you should be held accountable for being a complete failure if you are level 300. The heist leave absolutely no freedom of movement or planning and the missions do not make any sense.Some mission require 4 players (you cannot play without said number or above) yet some (I am thinking about you Pacific Standard van tracking thingy) have 2 useful roles and 2 utterly useless roles.When I say utterly useless I mean it. the goal of this mission is to use your cellphone to track 4 vans 2 players can track them the other two cannot. after tracking them you have to steal a specific van something ONE player can do with no problems whatsoever. And that's it. basically if you joined and are in the useless team (the drivers) you have absolutely nothing to do and that's it.Let me clarify the silliness of the missions for that I'll use the prison break example _ steal a prison bus store it near the prison._ steal a car and a prison schedule and an aircraft the car will be shipped off wherever for the guy you break out of prison._kill things.okay that part makes some sense. now the execution _2 guys go in the prison bus and break out the guy from the prison._1 guy get into the plane and flies it to the airfield near the prison (where you could have stored it beforehand but hey no freedom)_1 guy goes after another empty prison bus kills the driver and must drive it to the airfield to destroy it. then board an helicopter and defend the aircraft against jet fighters.Why in the nine hells do we steal and destroy the empty prison bus ? Even the guards remarks that the 2 guys team only have one prisonner and that's it. the other bus is ing EMPTY and going to the prison. and the 2 guys will have to kill all the prison guards anyway so basically an all out assault would have worked better.The heist appear to have been written by someone completely devoid of any sense.The content creator Good you can make your own missions...wait.Actually you can make your own missions within specific boundaries and again freedom is kind of a null value. you cannot make your own heists (the only thing that would have made perfect sense plan your own heists). The only uses we found for the content creator is to use it to raise your character's stats place 20 angry strippers with no weapons punch and get punched to raise your strength.Economy there's no economy in multiplayer where it would have made a lot of sense.the stock market is unavailable you cannot sell cars for a living you have to wait an hour or so (maybe half an hour I dont know) between every car sold and must sell only standard cars for 1/10 of their value. so far the maximum we know you can sell a car is 9250.Basically to get money you have to do heists over which you have little control or have a biker gang over which again you have little control and have to play with a bunch of .When I call players I have to put that into context you have absolutely no incentive to play nice _You are shown on the map stealth is out of the question unless you pay 500 to disappear for 1 minute which is not enough time to prepare ambushes anyway and is basically the time required to make the call for it._If a player destroys your car he will have to pay the insurrance but he can very well push you in a lake and you'll have to pay it._The players cannot assume a legal role._The risk of getting killed is always higher than risk of off a few players. Shoot first ask later._if you are ""fair play"" you earn 2000 dollars every time so often ... I would say every 2 hours. which means you get pocket change once a year for reference a good horn for your car costs 50000._if you bring a car to a heist if other players destroy it you have to pay the insurrance basically do not bring a car to a heist.But the real pain in the comes from the UI.In order to play with the people you want in multiplayer you have to launch GTA in solo (1) then go into play online closed session that will launch GTA multi (2) then you launch a heist(3) but wait someone has a problem or just quits you will be thrown back into a common session (4) in order to go back into a closed one you will have to relaunch gta solo (5) then repeat (6) and again (7)So basically if all goes well you will have endured 3 loading times.If not you will have endured X * 3 + X loading times assuming you quit with TASKKILL.

04/15/2015,0,0,64,FALSE,Recommended,First of all I think this game should have 2 reviews not one. First review for Storyline mode and the second review for the Online mode. Now my experience might be brief with Online but pretty revealing and my singleplayer experience so far has been a dream. Before I begin I must point out kudos to Rockstar for this port on my current machine GTAIV barely could run at minimal now I am running GTAV at medium at it works like a charm. This is how you do a console port.Storyline Mode + Good story &gt it really kept me interested in what was happening I didn't skip phone conversations or dialog since I was actually curious what was being said and I wanted to learn more. Nice use of the phone for this as well to deliver bits and pieces of story that makes you understand more about those around you.+ Great and diverse characters &gt the three main charcters are unique with their own motivations personalities wants and desires. I must say Michael for me got me really invested into the game great character.+ Good graphics &gt everything looks very good in this game and running it at medium I didn't feel at any moment as if this was just a game. Everything looks way to good.+ Overwhelming number of activities &gt so there is literally a ton of things you can do in game excluding story missions. Not to mention activities like meeting strange people who always make you do strange and entertaining things. You won't get bored easily believe me. You can even play and train your freaking dog in this game...+ Optimized for PC &gt I know a lot of people cannot start the game because of problems with Windows User thingy and Rockstar Club but once you get it started the game is surprisingly optimized for PC. GTAIV couldn't run on my laptop previously but GTAV really runs smoothly. I barely have stutter and that is only when everything on the screen gets chaotic due to too many explosions but that is the exception. I can't find anything optimization wise to complain about.+ Customization &gt Alright there are a lot of ways to customize your characters with a very diverse number of clothing options and you can also customize your cars like in a Need For Speed game.I have no cons for the Storyline mode so far. Maybe after I get even deeper into the game but so far I am really satisfied personally. This is the GTA game I have been waiting for.Online Mode + Good graphics &gt what? This applies to Online mode too. Game looks great either way no mater what mode you play.+ Overwhelming number of activities &gt Online mode also has its overwhelming number of activities to perform. However most of these do range from singleplayer types to multiplayer types. Like racing deathmatches heists and a lot more where you and other players can burn away the hours of the day.+ Optimized for PC &gt this one I must add again since really given that the map you play on is populated with other players this should normally lead to frame drops stutter and lag. Well I can't say I have experienced that so far for me playing Online with other people has caused no problem.+ Customization &gt the level of detail you can go into to in order to create your online character is astounding. This is a proper character customization tool upon creating your first character and I must say I am very impressed. Especially with the lineage part.+ Multiplayer ready &gt there are a lot of multiplayer only features designed to fit the game for online play which feel welcomed. Like the ability to deposit your money at an ATM so other players can't steal it from you. Players &gt well surprisingly enough the biggest con of Online mode is the players themselves. This is not like the GTA Sand Andreas roleplay servers where everyone tries to fit in the online world and enjoy. This is just people trying to enjoy the Online world with others and the rest who just wanna troll. Like any open pvp online game ever in existence there is no shortage of trolls and sadly you spend most of your time in Online mode playing the Hunger Games. The enjoyment is kind of drained from this.Overall GTAV is worth its praise it certainly is the best game Rockstar has made to date and if you ever enjoyed any of the GTA games in the past 2 decades then you will certainly enjoy this one too.,Grand Theft Auto V

06/15/2017,0,0,123,FALSE,Not Recommended,Take Two doesn't deserve your money. They only want to squeeze every last dollar they can out of you for a mediocre online experience that they haven't done anything to fix. They know that single player mods cause people to play less GTA Online and they see that as bad for their business. Don't reward these greedy scumbags for being as awful as possible to their fanbase.Oh I almost forgot they promised a single player DLC but then decided that it wasn't worth it because they get so much money from the Online game. We will never get a single player DLC because that's how unfortunately greedy they have become. DO NOT REWARD THEM FOR KILLING MODS.,Grand Theft Auto V
06/17/2017,0,0,227,FALSE,Not Recommended,These people keep getting more and more greedy. The in game microtransactions are honestly absurd in terms of price and now with this whole fiasco involving OpenIV C'mon how greedy can you get. They obviously have done things not only legally but with the well being of the game in mind in order to expand the experience this game has already 100% provided. So Take Two Interactive please get your heads out of your asses and start improving the game/servers yourself instead of adding another P.O.S update just to get more money out of people that bought this already expensive game. And stop harassing a company that only had good intentions.,Grand Theft Auto V

06/15/2017,0,0,97,FALSE,Not Recommended,"Basically Rock Star hates you and only cares about your money. That was obvious from the day it first released and the fact that it still cost a full $60 despite coming over a year later than the console versions. The screwing over didn't stop there though. They started charging ridiculous amounts of money for in game currency. Instead of discounting their game during Steam sales they would only sell ""discounted"" bundles that included this in game currency... but which still cost at least $60. When this currency apparently wasn't selling well enough they started adding a constant stream of crazily over priced in game items. It used to be that there were only a couple things you could get for over a million but now they're a dime a dozen.And all of these complaints are only valid when the game actually works. GTA V decided to buck the trend of other AAA games instead of improving over time it actually gets worse! Now It can take me up to thirty minutes just to get into an online game and stay in it. And recently hackers managed to somehow take all of my ammo rebuying it would cost over a hundred thousand in game dollars which would conservatively take about an hour to earn back.Finally they're recently started screwing over creators of single player mods which is hard to believe is anything other than an attempt to make even more money with some other upcoming monetization scheme.",Grand Theft Auto V

They dont create games for the educated consumer but they pray on the young (children) where mommy and daddy will had over the credit card to shut their kid up.

Look EA releases a new madden every year it the same damn game and ppl buy it for 60 bucks or more...If we were smart we ""gamers"" wouldnt pay for it make them offer new rosters as dlc for 20 bucks instead untill they really change the game..Also please note every time you buy ditigal content with ""cash"" the company makes 1000% profit as it takes the dev team minimal effort to make it. So the Question is how do we change it? We need to take responsibility which seems lost in the world today.And We must demand more from the game company and have legal repoisbilitys to the comsumer. I can bet that you local goverment probably does even know how toxic the bussiness practices are in the gaming industry.

09/10/2017,0,0,522,FALSE,Not Recommended,Oh god I could rant about this game forever but to keep from boring you too much I'll just give you something I posted to reddit about the current state of the game. Singleplayer is fine by the way online is the screwed up part. Okay basically how the cycle works is that players buy shark cards to buy in game items because they are too expensive (part of the reason mass hacking is also a problem) and would take forever to work towards. Rockstar uses the shark card money to release free DLC. The thing that angers me is that the DLC that Rockstar releases is benefitting the players who are loaded and have lots of money because of their shark cards (or hacking). They never make DLC adding varieties of way for the rest of the players to make more money. So while I m grinding for a yacht 12 more 6 million dollar cars get released and it s impossible to keep up with. So what we have here is Rockstar is essentially just helping people who purchase shark cards. On top of that they are literally giving hackers (that they always complain about but never fix) more power because they have money just like the people with the shark cards. Oh and also all the DLC they release is essentially the same thing except branded differently. So in conclusion the online aspect has dug itself into so many holes it's honestly a point of no return.,Grand Theft Auto V

02/25/2017,1,3,1159,FALSE,Recommended,When you read most of the reviews for GTA V Most will say they got banned and such. Well from my recent experiences it's quite true. Rockstar have been really strict with their rules lately and last christmas there was a huge ban wave which made most players that got banned confused and obviously. For me on the other hand as long as you play safe and just stay away from all the things that can you get banned E.G Getting dropped money Helped by a modder/hacker during heist or mission or whatever really. And you should be fine. GTA V is obviously what you would expect just an open world game where there are tons of games missions and such. If you want to buy this game you have to get some friends honestly if you don't this game will get boring quite fast. For now i'm not sure if rockstar will expand Online more since i think they have to deal with Red Dead 2 soon and the recent DLC Import and Export was quite huge so i'm not so sure if they will add more content to Online.

I mean you have already sold the game to millions of people why not just restrict their acess to the single player experience so everyone who loves the world of gta has to stay in online mode forever so you have better chances to sell those chalk cards. Great business model here take two sell full experience and then restrict it. Maybe also then sell the modding ability as the DLC that has been there only for the online mode low effort big cash.

Modding games is one of the biggest components of PC gaming. Taking this component away by threatening legal action is an extremely short sighted move from Take Two Interactive. Not only will this destroy a major part of the GTA V playerbase but if this is enforced in GTA 6 as well this will destroy a major part of a potential future playerbase as well.If I could I would refund this game immediately since a company which doesn't respect its customers isn't worthy of my money.,Grand Theft Auto V

06/15/2017,0,0,179,FALSE,Not Recommended,Following the information from Jimpquisition 15 June 2017 regarding Take Two Interactive (owner of rockstar games) has issued a cease and decist order to Open IV the popular modding tool. It was known not to put mods and use them for the GTA online portion of the game for the sake of cheaters the like... makes sense so far. The crux is Open IV had strict tennants on their mods (to name one specifically they can only be created and designed for the single player portion) so they were creating mods within the terms of service. They bent over backwards to ensure this and that all mod creators were also working within the legalaties to ensure no terms of service were breached. This went on for YEARS in which Rockstar Games not only publicly stated they had no issue with this form of modding on their games and actively promoted some of the mods available on Open IV on their own official blog! For the Take Two to suddenly do a switch threatening legal action?! I thought EA Ubi and Activision were bad with the antics they pull. But this if effectively telling a party they are fine doing what they are with their IP to then suddenly change their stance and threaten legal action?! that is insane. Livelyhoods could have been created on the back of this. Its aboslutely disgusting what they have done.,Grand Theft Auto V
